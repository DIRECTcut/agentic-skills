# 02 - Proof Loop: Verification Through Durable Artifacts

**Source:** OpenClaw-RL paper (arxiv 2603.10165) + DenisSergeevitch/repo-task-proof-loop

## Overview

The Proof Loop pattern ensures that AI agents cannot self-certify task completion. Instead of trusting an agent's claim that "it works," the pattern requires durable, verifiable artifacts -- test outputs, log files, verdict documents -- as evidence. A separate verifier in a fresh session (one that never witnessed the build process) examines the repository state and renders a verdict.

**Core principle:** Next-state signals are universal proof. Test results, tool outputs, user reactions -- these are all verification evidence. An agent cannot simply declare completion; it must produce artifacts that an independent party can verify.

## Execution Protocol

The protocol follows a strict sequence:

```
spec freeze --> build --> evidence --> fresh verify --> fix --> verify again
```

### Step 1: Spec Freeze

Define concrete acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, ...) before any implementation begins. These criteria are:

- **Concrete** -- each criterion maps to a testable condition
- **Frozen** -- no changes once implementation starts
- **Enumerated** -- explicitly numbered for tracking

Example:
```
AC1: Login endpoint returns 200 with valid credentials
AC2: Login endpoint returns 401 with invalid credentials
AC3: Rate limiting kicks in after 5 failed attempts within 60 seconds
AC4: JWT token expires after 24 hours
```

### Step 2: Build

Implement the minimum safe changeset that addresses the acceptance criteria. The builder:

- Writes code to satisfy each AC
- Keeps changes minimal and focused
- Does NOT self-evaluate quality

### Step 3: Evidence Collection

After building, the builder switches to **read-only mode** and collects evidence:

- Runs the test suite, captures output to a file
- Captures relevant log output
- Documents the state of each AC (pass/fail with evidence)
- Stores evidence in the repository (e.g., `.agent/tasks/{task-id}/evidence/`)

**Critical:** The builder collects evidence but does NOT render a verdict. Evidence and judgment are separate responsibilities.

### Step 4: Fresh Verify

A **new session** -- one that has never seen the build process -- examines:

- The repository state (code changes)
- The evidence files
- The acceptance criteria

The verifier produces a `verdict.json`:
```json
{
  "task_id": "login-auth-flow",
  "verdict": "FAIL",
  "ac_results": {
    "AC1": "PASS",
    "AC2": "PASS",
    "AC3": "FAIL - rate limit triggers at 10 attempts, not 5",
    "AC4": "PASS"
  },
  "problems": ["Rate limit threshold is 10, AC3 requires 5"]
}
```

### Step 5: Fix

If the verdict is FAIL:

- Read `problems.md` or the verdict file
- Apply **minimal** fixes targeting only the failing ACs
- Regenerate evidence

### Step 6: Loop

Repeat steps 4-5 until the verdict is PASS across all acceptance criteria.

## Four Sub-Agent Roles

Each role has strict boundaries to prevent contamination:

| Role | Reads | Writes | Cannot Do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec-freezer** | Repository, requirements, existing tests | Acceptance criteria document | Touch code |
| **Builder** | Spec, codebase | Code changes, then evidence (read-only switch) | Render verdict |
| **Verifier** | Repo state, evidence, acceptance criteria | Verdict only | See build history, modify code |
| **Fixer** | Verdict, problems list, code | Minimal targeted fixes | Sign final approval |

### Why these boundaries matter

- **Spec-freezer** does not touch code because spec and implementation must be independent
- **Builder** switches to read-only for evidence because the same agent that wrote the code will be biased about its quality
- **Verifier** uses a fresh session because shared context creates shared blind spots
- **Fixer** cannot approve because the same entity that patches should not also certify

## Key Differences from Anthropic Harness

The Proof Loop extends the Harness Design pattern (see [01-harness-design.md](01-harness-design.md)) with important distinctions:

| Aspect | Anthropic Harness | Proof Loop |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact storage** | Conversation history | Repository (`.agent/tasks/`) |
| **Verifier isolation** | Separate prompt in same session | Fresh session (separate context entirely) |
| **Spec mutability** | Sprint Contract can change mid-sprint | Spec frozen before build begins |
| **Evidence format** | Evaluator's judgment | Durable files (test output, logs, verdict.json) |
| **Recommended runtime** | Any LLM agent | Designed for Codex-class sub-agents, works in Claude Code |

### Why repository-based artifacts?

- Conversation history is ephemeral -- it disappears with the session
- Repository artifacts survive context resets, session changes, and model swaps
- Other agents (or humans) can independently verify the same artifacts
- Git provides versioning and audit trail for free

### Why fresh-session verification?

A verifier in the same session has seen:
- The builder's reasoning process
- The builder's confidence signals
- Intermediate states that may have been "fixed"

This creates anchoring bias. A fresh session sees only the final state and the evidence, judging purely on outcomes.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules

The Proof Loop includes explicit guards against agents fabricating completion:

1. **Tests passed?** -- Requires a file with actual output, not the text "tests passed"
2. **Review done?** -- Requires an artifact with specific findings, not "I reviewed it, looks good"
3. **Subtask complete?** -- Check the state file, do not trust the agent's claim
4. **Parallel/subagent tasks:** Before accepting results, verify that child processes actually completed -- do not trust status claims from sub-agents

---

## File Structure

A typical Proof Loop task directory in the repository:

```
.agent/tasks/
  login-auth-flow/
    spec.md                 # Frozen acceptance criteria
    evidence/
      test-output.txt       # Raw test runner output
      coverage-report.html  # Coverage artifact
      api-responses.json    # Captured API responses
    verdict.json            # Verifier's judgment
    problems.md             # Issues found (if FAIL)
    fix-log.md              # What the fixer changed and why
```

---

## When to Use

**Good fit:**
- Production deployments where failure has real cost
- Tasks requiring audit trails (compliance, security)
- Multi-agent handoffs where trust boundaries are important
- Any task where "the agent says it works" is not sufficient

**Overkill:**
- Quick prototyping
- Single-file changes with obvious correctness
- Exploratory coding where the spec is still forming

## Relationship to Other Principles

- **Harness Design (01):** Proof Loop extends the Generator-Evaluator pattern with fresh-session verification
- **Autoresearch (03):** Autoresearch optimizes iteratively; Proof Loop verifies the final result
- **Deterministic Orchestration (04):** Anti-Fabrication is a shared concern -- both patterns insist on artifacts over claims
- **Codified Context (07):** The `.agent/tasks/` directory structure is codified context -- structured handoff artifacts
