# Claude Code Skills & Principles

Curated skills, architectural principles, and decision frameworks for Claude Code.

A collection of battle-tested `.claude/skills/` and a universal `CLAUDE.md` distilled from real production work -- multi-agent orchestration, AI/ML pipelines, code review, frontend craft, and more.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AnastasiyaW/claude-code-skills.git

# Copy skills you need into your project
cp -r claude-code-skills/skills/deep-review ~/.claude/skills/

# Or copy the full CLAUDE.md as your global config
cp claude-code-skills/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Claude Code picks them up automatically.

## Principles Overview

The `CLAUDE.md` file encodes 8 architectural principles for AI-assisted development. Each one addresses a specific failure mode observed in real agent workflows.

| # | Principle | Core Idea |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Harness Design** | Generator and Evaluator must be separate agents. Models praise their own work (self-evaluation bias). Source: Anthropic Engineering. |
| 2 | **Proof Loop** | `spec freeze -> build -> evidence -> fresh verify -> fix -> loop`. Agents cannot self-certify completion -- durable artifacts required. Source: OpenClaw-RL. |
| 3 | **Autoresearch** | Read -> Change ONE thing -> Test mechanically -> Keep/Discard -> Repeat. Any measurable output can be improved automatically. Source: Karpathy. |
| 4 | **Deterministic Orchestration** | Shell Bypass (mechanical tasks skip the LLM), Relay Pattern (one task at a time), Findings Taxonomy (structured knowledge capture). Source: Memento. |
| 5 | **Structured Reasoning** | Replace free-form chain-of-thought with: Premises -> Execution Trace -> Conclusions -> Rejected Paths. Eliminates planning hallucinations. |
| 6 | **Multi-Agent Decomposition** | Coordinator distributes tasks, specialized sub-agents execute. Coordination via shared artifacts in repo, not conversation history. |
| 7 | **Codified Context** | Context is infrastructure, not documentation. CLAUDE.md = runtime config. Memory = persistent state. JIT loading over full-context dumps. |
| 8 | **Skills Best Practices** | Skill descriptions are model triggers, not human docs. Mandatory Gotchas section. Critical validations belong in scripts, not words. |

## Alternative Approaches

The `alternatives/` directory contains comparison documents for key architectural decisions:

- **Orchestration** -- Memento vs Roo Code vs manual skill chains
- **Code Review** -- deep-review skill vs CodeRabbit vs Semgrep vs manual PR review
- **Optimization** -- Autoresearch vs HyperAgent vs manual iteration
- **Context Management** -- Codified Context vs vanilla CLAUDE.md vs .cursorrules

Each document follows the same structure: what the approach does, when to pick it, known tradeoffs.

## Recommended External Tools

These complement the skills and principles in this repo:

- **[gstack](https://github.com/nichochar/gstack)** -- Dev workflow skills for Claude Code: /review, /qa, /ship, /investigate, /design-review, /retro, and more.
- **[hookify](https://github.com/AstroMined/hookify)** -- Git hooks generator for Claude Code. Pre-commit validation, lint, format.
- **[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)** -- Static analysis rules. Pairs well with `deep-review` for automated security/quality gates.
- **[Memento](https://github.com/mderk/memento)** -- MCP workflow engine. Implements the Deterministic Orchestration patterns from CLAUDE.md as executable workflows.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Add or improve a skill in `skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. Follow the Skills Best Practices from `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Description = trigger for the model, not human-readable summary
   - Include `## Gotchas` with real failure cases
   - Include `## Troubleshooting` with symptom -> cause -> fix
   - Keep SKILL.md under 5000 words; details go in `references/`
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what the skill does and when to use it

For principles or alternatives, open an issue first to discuss the addition.
